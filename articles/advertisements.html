        <h1>ADVERTISEMENTS</h1>
        <p>
            Many websites and free apps often contain advertisements. Advertisements themselves aren't necessarily
            a dark pattern, it's okay to include them in your website or free app as long as they are not intrusive.
        </p>
        <p>
            They only become a dark pattern if they become intrusive to the user experience, how advertising may become
            intrusive can be through the following methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interrupting the intended experience by forcing users to watch an ad.
                <ul>
                    <li>This ad could be an unskippable ad, meaning users have to go the full length watching the ad.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tricking you into clicking on an ad by placing it where you will often click on something.</li>
        </ul>
