            Many websites and free apps often contain advertisements. Advertisements themselves aren't necessarily
            a dark pattern, it's okay to include them in your website or free app as long as they are not intrusive.
        </p>
        <p>
            They only become a dark pattern if they become intrusive to the user experience, how advertising may become
            intrusive can be through the following methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interrupting the intended experience by forcing users to watch an ad.
                <ul>
                    <li>This ad could be an unskippable ad, meaning users have to go the full length watching the ad.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tricking you into clicking on an ad by placing it where you will often click on something.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Organisations earn income from displaying advertisements on their websites or apps, the total revenue gained
            from this can depend on the kind of ad displayed and how many ads are shown. Because of this, companies looking
            to gain more profits will be incentivised to display as many ads as possible to their users, preferrably intrusive
            and/or long form ads since they seem to pay the most. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Excessive Advertising will result in user frustration. Many apps that have a paid subscription service use this
            to their advantage by having one of the perks be an ad-free experience, so a user could give into their frustration
            over these excessive ads and sign up to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A free and efficient solution to these excessive ads however is the use of adblockers. Many popular adblockers such
            as uBlock are free to install through the Chrome or Firefox Web Stores and are able to block advertisements with around
            the same efficiency as the website's paid ad-free service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many companies have fought back against adblockers however, typically through intrusive elements such as popups that
            will go away if the user turns off their adblocker. In most cases they can be clicked off, though the button to do
            this may be small, lacks visibility and/or involves confirm shaming. Adblockers though have adapted to this and can 
            block such intrusive elements too. It's basically an uphill battle of income vs enjoyability.
